My name is Isabella and I enjoy a variety of activities such as playing video games, sewing, karate, and learning new things about coding! I am working on filling this portfolio with my future works of applications. Hopefully you enjoy my current and future work. Constructive critisism and help is alway appreciated. I was born in Arizona and raised in Florida, but I traveled a lot across the country because my father is a pilot. I had as many as 18 pets at one time when I was little, and I still have a passion for animals today. I have a cat and hamster at this current time. I hope to find a nice job in the IT or coding department after I complete this course.
